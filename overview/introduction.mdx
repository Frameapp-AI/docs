## Overview

Mosaic's REST API allows you to kick off professional-grade video editing workflows ("Agents") entirely from code. An agent is a pre-built graph of AI and rendering nodes that can do anything from audio enhancement to animated captions – you supply a video and optional parameters, Mosaic returns a polished result.

### Typical flow

1. **Upload a video** – Get a signed URL and PUT the bytes (`/video/get-upload-url`, `/video/finalize-upload`).
2. **Run an agent** – Call `/run-agent` with the `file_id` you just created.
3. **Track progress** – Poll `/get-agent-run-simple/{id}` or subscribe to a webhook.
4. **Download outputs** – Fetch signed URLs via `/get-agent-run-outputs/{id}`.

Grab the full walk-through in the [Quickstart](/quickstart).

## Authentication

Mosaic supports two flavours of authentication:

### 1. API Keys (Production traffic)

Use an API key **prefixed `mk_`** for all operational endpoints (`/run-agent`, polling status, downloading outputs etc.).

```bash
# Bearer header
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mk_your_key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.usemosaic.ai/api/run-agent

# X-API-Key header (alternative)
curl -H "X-API-Key: mk_your_key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.usemosaic.ai/api/run-agent
```

### 2. Session Tokens (Developer Portal)

When you log in to the Mosaic dashboard you receive a short-lived JWT issued by Supabase. Use this to manage API keys and check your credit balance under the `/api/dev` namespace.

## Rate Limiting & Quotas

| Plan | Concurrent Runs | Upload Size | Free Credits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pro | 10 | 10 GiB | 20 000 |
| Enterprise | custom | custom | custom |

*Additional* request-per-minute limits only apply to developer-portal endpoints.

## Error Handling

Responses use conventional HTTP status codes. On errors the body contains a machine-readable `error` field plus a human friendly `detail`.

```json
{
  "detail": "Too many concurrent runs",
  "error": "concurrent_agent_limit"
}
```

| Status | Error Code | Typical Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | validation_error | Malformed JSON or missing field |
| 401 | invalid_api_key | Key revoked / wrong value |
| 403 | concurrent_agent_limit | > 10 running agents (Free plan) |
| 403 | insufficient_credits | Balance too low |
| 404 | not_found | Unknown ID |
| 422 | parameter_out_of_range | Field outside validation bounds |
| 429 | rate_limit | > 120 requests / min to `/api/dev/*` |
| 500 | internal_server_error | Unexpected exception |
