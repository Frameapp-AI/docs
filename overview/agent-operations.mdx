## GET /get-user-agents-simple

Return a lightweight list of **your own agents** – handy for populating dropdowns or showing recent creations in a UI.

| Query | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| limit | integer (1-100) | all | Caps the number of agents returned (newest first) |

Authentication is identical to other operational endpoints:
* Bearer API key (`mk_…`) or `X-API-Key` header
* Supabase session JWT for the Mosaic dashboard

### Example – list the five most-recent agents
```bash
curl -s "https://api.usemosaic.ai/api/get-user-agents-simple?limit=5" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOSAIC_API_KEY"
```

### Response
```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "agent-uuid",
      "name": "My Caption Preset",
      "description": "Animated captions in brand colours",
      "created_at": "2025-06-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

> The endpoint returns only **your** agents; there is no global marketplace yet. Results are sorted by `created_at` descending.

### Response

---

## GET /get-agent-run-simple/{agent_run_id}

---

## GET /get-agent-run-outputs/{agent_run_id}

```json
{
  "outputs": [
    {
      "node_id": "node_uuid",

---

## GET /download-rendered-video/{agent_run_node_id}

Direct download for a specific node when you already know its ID.

> **Tip**: Prefer `/get-agent-run-outputs` which shields you from internal node identifiers. 

---

## POST /retry-agent-run-node/{agent_run_node_id}

Retry a specific **failed** node within an agent run instead of re-running the entire workflow.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| agent_run_node_id (path) | UUID | ✅ | ID of the node to retry. Must currently have `status=failed`. |

Authentication: same as other operational endpoints – Bearer API key (`mk_…`) **or** Supabase session. Anonymous requests are rejected with `401`.

### Request
```http
POST /retry-agent-run-node/{agent_run_node_id}
Authorization: Bearer mk_live_xxx…
Content-Type: application/json

{}
```

### Successful response

  "status": "initiated",
  "message": "Agent run node retry initiated"
}
```
