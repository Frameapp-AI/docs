## GET /dev/keys

List all API keys for the authenticated user.

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "id": "key_uuid",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "last_used_at": "2024-01-02T12:34:56Z",
      "webhook_url": "https://example.com/webhook"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## POST /dev/keys/create

Creates a new API key and returns the **plaintext** value once. Store it securely – it can't be retrieved later.

---

## PATCH /dev/keys/{key_id}

Update an existing key. The most common use-case is to set or change the webhook URL that receives run completion events.

```json
{
  "webhook_url": "https://example.com/webhook"
}
```

---

## DELETE /dev/keys/{key_id}

Immediately revokes a key. Existing in-flight runs are not affected.

---

## GET /dev/credits/balance

Returns the remaining credit balance for your account.

```json
{
  "credits_remaining": 1000.0
}
```
