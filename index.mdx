# Mosaic API

Mosaic lets you automate professional-grade video editing with a single REST call. Run pre-built "Agents" – AI workflows that do everything from audio enhancement to automatic cropping and animated captions – then download the finished clip.

## Core Concepts

### Agent
A saved workflow graph that can be executed via `/run-agent`. Mosaic ships with a library of ready-made agents and more are added every month.

### Agent Run
An execution instance of an agent. Tracks progress (`queued → running → completed|failed`) and stores per-node metadata.

### File ID
Every uploaded asset receives a UUID (v4). Use this `file_id` when kicking off agents, or pass a local file in by using our signed url upload method.

### Credits
Billing is usage-based and function the same as the web UI. Failed runs automatically refund any unspent credits.
