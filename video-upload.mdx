title: "Video Upload"
description: "Upload large video files in two steps before running an agent."

Mosaic uses signed URLs so you can upload directly to cloud storage without routing bytes through our API servers.

---

## POST /video/get-upload-url

Returns a pre-signed URL.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| filename | string | ✅ | Original file name |
| file_size | integer | ✅ | Size in bytes |
| content_type | string | ✅ | MIME type, e.g. `video/mp4` |
| project_id | string | | Session-auth only – override auto-created project |

### Sample Request
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.usemosaic.ai/api/video/get-upload-url" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mk_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename":"video.mp4","file_size":1048576,"content_type":"video/mp4"}'
```

### Sample Response
```json
{
  "upload_url": "https://signed-gcs-url",
  "video_id": "video_uuid",
  "temp_path": "temp/path"
}
```

---

## PUT {upload_url}

Upload the bytes to the signed URL. Make sure to set the same `Content-Type` you passed in the previous call.

---

## POST /video/finalize-upload/{video_id}

Converts the temporary object into a permanent asset and returns a `file_uuid` to use with agents.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| skip_project_creation | boolean | | Session-auth only |

### Sample Response
```json
{
  "file_uuid": "file_uuid",
  "file_name": "video.mp4",
  "url": "https://storage-url/video.mp4"
}
```

> **Retry-safe**: The `finalize-upload` endpoint is idempotent – calling it twice with the same `video_id` returns the same `file_uuid`.
