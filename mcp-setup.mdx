---

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** lets you connect AI assistants like Claude Desktop directly to Mosaic's hosted server. Once configured, you can upload videos, run agents, and download outputs using natural language â€“ no local server required.

## Prerequisites

1. A Mosaic API key (`mk_â€¦`) from the [Developer Portal](https://app.usemosaic.ai)
2. [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed on your machine
3. Node.js (for `npx` command)

## 1 Â· Configure Claude Desktop

Edit Claude Desktop's config file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the Mosaic MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mosaic-api": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote@latest",
        "https://mcp.usemosaic.ai",
        "--http-only",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer mk_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows you may have to use the following config to avoid path issues:

```json
"mosaic-api": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "-y",
    "mcp-remote@latest",
    "https://mcp.usemosaic.ai",
    "--http-only",
    "--header",
    "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}"
  ],
  "env": {
    "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer mk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "APPDATA":  "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming",
    "NPM_CONFIG_CACHE": "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm-cache"
  }
}
```

> **Important:** Replace `mk_your_api_key_here` with your actual Mosaic API key.

## 2 Â· Test the connection

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely (quit and reopen)
2. Start a new conversation
3. You should see a small ðŸ”Œ icon indicating MCP tools are available
4. Try asking: *"What Mosaic tools do you have available?"*

Claude should respond with a list of available tools like `upload_video_from_url` (`upload_video_from_local_file` is not supported
on the remotely hosted MCP server), `create_or_run_agent`, etc.

## 3 Â· Example usage

Once connected, you can ask Claude to:

- *"Upload this video file from this url and create a 30-second trailer with captions"*
- *"List my available Mosaic agents"*  
- *"Check the status of run ID abc123"*
- *"Give me the download link for the outputs from my latest agent run"*

Claude will automatically call the appropriate MCP tools and handle the Mosaic API interactions for you.

## Local development (optional)

If you want to run the MCP server locally for development:

1. Clone the [examples repo](https://github.com/mosaic-ai-labs/api-examples)
2. Follow the setup in [`mosaic-mcp/README.md`](https://github.com/mosaic-ai-labs/api-examples/tree/main/mosaic-mcp)
3. Change the URL to `http://localhost:8000` in your Claude config

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| ðŸ”Œ icon not showing | Check the config file path and restart Claude Desktop |
| "Authorization failed" | Verify your API key is correct and starts with `mk_` |
| "Command not found" error | Ensure Node.js is installed (`node --version`) |
| Tools timeout | Check your internet connection to `mcp.usemosaic.ai` |

<Note type="tip">The hosted MCP server is the easiest way to get started. For advanced use cases or custom modifications, see the [Mosaic MCP Server example](/example-apps/mosaic-mcp-server).</Note>
