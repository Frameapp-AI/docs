Configure a webhook URL on any API key (via the dashboard or `/dev/keys` endpoints) and Mosaic will POST a JSON payload every time a run finishes.

Mosaic signs each request so you can verify authenticity.

---

## Signature Scheme

```text
X-Mosaic-Signature: t=1716912345,v1=af319…sha256
```

The header contains a Unix timestamp (`t`) and a HMAC-SHA256 signature (`v1`). Compute the digest locally and compare using constant-time equality.

```python
import hmac, hashlib, time

secret = b"mk_your_api_key"  # yes, the same key value
stamp  = header_ts  # integer
msg    = f"{stamp}.".encode() + payload_bytes
expected = hmac.new(secret, msg, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
```

Reject the request if
1. The computed signature does not match.
2. The timestamp is more than 5 minutes from current time.
